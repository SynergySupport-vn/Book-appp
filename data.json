Then there's the need for fellowship and companionship. The need for self–actualization is at the top of the pyramid. Understanding this hierarchy can provide the leverage to hone your message and entice customers.\n\nAcceptance is what we all crave. We just want to feel like we belong somewhere. We must all eat and drink. Use what you've learned to illustrate how your product can help consumers meet their needs and thrive in life. If you're in the business of technical enhancement training, for example, your website must explicitly state that you teach people. Then, you must figure out how to craft a message that ties technical training to your customers' survival needs. You may demonstrate how professional training would allow them to earn more money and better care for themselves.

Unlike the erratic honking of cars and odd noises we hear and forget almost instantly, a good story sticks in the mind after a single listen, much like a melody. Music follows a set of rules and patterns that are easily recognized. A pattern can also be found in good tales.\n\nMake a message as infectious as a melody by turning it into a story if you want to project your brand. The StoryBrand 7–Part Framework, also known as the “SB7 Framework,” is a simple way to accomplish this.\n\nThe SB7 Framework harnesses the influence of stories. The structure describes the 7 most common story elements:\n• Character\n• Problem\n• Guide\n• Plan\n• Calls to action\n• Failure\n• Success\n\nThe remaining chapters in this summary will explain each of these modules in turn. For now, a skeletal explanation of how the components fuse together is given.\n\nIn every story, the protagonist is the focus of attention. Their character is at the center of the plot. They have a strong desire for something impossible to obtain. This issue is caused by this complexity. Just as they are about to give up, a guide appears and proposes a solution to the dilemma. The guide instructs the character to behave in accordance with the strategy. To escape failure, the character must stick to the plan in order to fulfill her first desire. This story arc can be crafted for every type of brand. Once you’ve got your script sorted, it will provide the ammunition you need to win and keep the attention of your customers.

When you make provisions for something like a premium package that offers extra services that others do not, you will find that people aspire to that status. People are drawn to what they don't have and what sets them apart from others.\n\nSell the idea of completeness. Customers must be able to see the possibility of fulfillment of your product. They should get the impression that without your product, they are incomplete. As a result, they should aspire to surpass all others in order to be united with what you have to give.\n\nSelf–acceptance and realizing your ability is the third approach. Allow people to feel at ease in their own skin. Assist them in accepting themselves as they are. They would associate with you if the product communicates with ordinary people and tells them that there is nothing wrong with them.\n\nWhen the movie's good guy nerd finally wins the beautiful girl's heart, it gives all male nerds a sense of identity, elevates their status, and makes them feel whole.

Everything revolves around them. It is their problem you are trying to solve. The story must focus on them.\n\nIdentify a specific desire and make it into a problem that needs to be solved. This problem is the villain that the hero of the story must vanquish. Present a troubling situation that the hero must find help to resolve.\n\nYour company is the guide that provides wisdom and help to the hero in the hour of need. Show clearly that you understand their frustration and have the capacity to help them out of the quagmire.\n\nLay out the steps that must be taken to defeat the villain or assure your customers that they are in safe hands and the only outcome of this situation is success as long as they follow your guidance.\n\nProd them to take action by asking them to buy your product (direct call to action) or encouraging them to establish a relationship with you (transitional call to action) that will make them remember you whenever they have this need. You can do this by giving them a memorable gift.\n\nExplain the dangers of not taking decisive action now and show them how making the purchase makes them part of something greater than them. Sell a vision and not just a product. The sense of identity and belonging will create a long-lasting bond of fellowship between your brand and your customers.\n\nTry this\n\nTo show your customers that your product will help them achieve their dreams, associate your brand with someone who is already successful. Take Red Bull, for example. They associate with successful athletes to show that Red Bull gives you wings. To whom or what can you associate your brand to feed your customers with inspiration?",

Minor stressors may seem isolated at first, but over time, they fuse into serious health issues. Parenting, traffic jams, a slight increase in blood pressure, etc., are common sources of worry. Feeling stressed then compounds into more significant problems.\n\nNegative thoughts can also aggregate. Accumulating thoughts that don’t enhance life will create a negative reality for you.

Operators point at objects and call out commands as they do so. They call out every item and state what should be done with it. This seemingly mundane activity lowers risk by bringing things you were formerly unconscious of into your consciousness.\n\nAnother critical step to behavior change is to keep a habit scorecard. This scorecard contains a list of patterns you practice daily, whether good, neutral, or bad. Neutral habits get the = sign, good ones get a + sign, and bad ones get a – sign. You have positive tendencies if you get a positive score from adding all your habits. A negative net score indicates a negative pattern.\n\nTake your time changing your habits initially.

You won’t be overwhelmed doing something completely different and figuring your way from scratch. Instead, your existing routines will provide you with the necessary comfort, and you’ll complement them with minor changes.\n\nThe effectiveness of routine stacking depends on the foundational cue that begins the chain. You don’t have to worry about time and location with this technique. The existing pattern has built in those details.\n\nThese strategies are effective ways to apply the first law of behavior change. The cues they create are vivid, and the correct application makes it easy to elicit new behavior.\n\nYour environment often leads you to make certain choices that betray your identity. Subtly, your environment can make you behave in specific ways. Kurt Lewin suggested that behavior is a function performed by a person under the conditions of their environment. You should be more aware of that and know when not to succumb to the impulses the outside world creates for you. For example, if you want to quit smoking and your friends smoke frequently, you should note when your urge to smoke appears just because you don’t want to miss out.\n\nLess than 20 years later, an economist, Hawkins Stern, found that the same principle applies to advertising. Stern found that seeing a product for the first time can make shoppers create a need in their minds for the product. He called the phenomenon “suggestion impulse buying.”",

Satisfaction comes from surmounting some form of obstacle. Deliberate practice keeps you sharp and opens your eyes to errors that a routine may not see.\n\nFor example, a person who has learned to drive may find it difficult to continue to see aspects of their driving that need improvement after a while.
